A friend recently shared a fun, holiday-themed coding puzzle site. It's called [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). From December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is posted daily. Each puzzle has two steps, and you need to successfully give the answer to the first step to access the second step. The puzzles get more challenging as the month progresses. I only learned about this last month, and I completed about ten puzzles from 2019, and they were lots of fun. Now that the month has officially started, I've switched to focusing on the 2020 puzzles. There's also a reddit community which seems fairly active, which will surely come in handy as the puzzles grow more challenging. 

The puzzles can be done with essentially any programming language you choose, although so far I have found python very convenient because all of the input is given as a text file. If it sounds interesting, check it out!


P.S. Hello, world! My goal is to have one blog post a week, minimum. I'll be posting mostly computer science, statistics, and math related posts, but maybe I will also branch out and post some book reviews.
