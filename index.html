	<p>This is the personal webpage and blog of Evangelie Zachos. She completed her PhD in inverse problems (in pure mathematics) in June, 2020. At her time at Stanford, she completed multiple classes in statistics, machine learning, and causal inference.</p>

	<p>From June until mid-September, she worked at Cisco as a software engineering intern in Innovations lab. The team of 6 people was working on a project involving studying wifi latency, and she used matlab to debug and analyze wifi packets collected using software defined radios. She used python to create visualizations for this data, and in the final weeks of her internship she created and tuned a tensor flow neural network to imitate the output of the matlab decoding code.</p>

	<p>This webpage doesn't have photos or a lot of information, but look for additional updates to come throughout October! </p>
