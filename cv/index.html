---

<p>A current copy of my CV can be found <a href="/cv/Zachos_resume.pdf"> here</a>. </p>

<h2 id="thesis">Dissertation</h2>
	 <p>My dissertation was entitled 'The X-ray transform on asymptotically Euclidean spaces' and can be accessed electronically <a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/cd456sc6319">here.</a> 
	 A paper with an extended result is currently being revised and prepared for submission with the preprint available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11706">here</a>. There are slides for talks. </p>
<h3 id="talks">Slides for Talks</h3>
	 
	  <p>Here are slides for <a href="/cv/2021-12-01.pdf">a talk given at the CMS Session on "Geometric Tomography and Microlocal Analysis"</a> in December, 2021. This talk was designed for mathematicians familiar with microlocal analysis.  </p>
	  
	  <p>Here are slides for <a href="/cv/2022-02-09.pdf">a talk given at UCSC's Analysis and Geometry Seminar</a> in February, 2022, which assume no particular background in microlocal analysis. </p>


<h2 id="interests">More Recent Work and Research Interests</h2>

<p>Since my PhD, I have spent time working in machine learning and growing my understanding of software development and signal processing. 
Although I am particularly interested in network communications, I have applied signal processing and AI techniques to a variety of data sets, including medical and machine maintenance. </p>
